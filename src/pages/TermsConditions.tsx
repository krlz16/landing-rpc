        <h3>4. Risk Disclaimer</h3>
        <h4>4.1 New Technology</h4>
        <p>
          The Services is a new technology. While this software has been extensively tested, the software used for these services is still relatively new and could have bugs or security vulnerabilities. Further, the software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time that may not meet users’ expectations.
          <br />
          Declining changes or updates to your device or browser may expose the Services to increased security risk. We shall not be liable to you for any losses you may suffer as a result of failing to complete any updates to your device or browser.
        </p>
        <h4>4.2 Information Security Risk</h4>
        <p>
          The API keys you use to access the Services may be at risk if the security of your device or browser is compromised. You should therefore ensure that you keep your device and browser safe and secure in accordance with best practices recommended by the provider of your operating system, such as setting up a "strong" PIN and/or password to prevent unauthorised access and ensuring that you keep your software up to date.
          <br /><br />
          You are responsible for ensuring that your mobile device is secure. Do not use the Services on a device that has been "jailbroken", "cracked", "rooted" or otherwise had restrictions in the software removed, as this may compromise the security of your account.
          <br /><br />
          Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Services in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
          <br /><br />
          In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.
