        <h3>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h3>
        <p>
          Please note that some of our Service Providers may be based outside of Uruguay or the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). These Service Providers may work for us or for one of our suppliers and may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your request for information, products and services, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
          <br /><br />
          If applicable, when we transfer your data to a Service Provider that is outside of Uruguay or the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld. Transfers of personal data are either made:
        </p>
        <ul className="nav1">
          <li>
            to a country recognised by Uruguay or the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection; or
          </li>
          <li>
            to a country which does not offer adequate protection but whose transfer has been governed by the standard contractual clauses of the applicable law or by implementing other appropriate cross-border transfer solutions to provide adequate protection.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. If you would like more information about the mechanism via which your personal data is transferred please contact legal@iovlabs.org.

            <b><u>Erasure:</u></b> You will have the right to request the erasure of your personal data, so that it is not processed by us, although your request may not always be possible, since we might have the obligation to keep certain personal data due to the technical impossibility to delete it or in order to fulfill with legal requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b><u>Object Processing:</u></b> You may object to processing of your personal data where we rely on legitimate interest for processing that personal data.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>To exercise any of the rights listed above and/or any other right stated by the applicable law, you can contact us to legal@iovlabs.org. We will immediately process your request and inform you the results within the term established by the applicable law.</p>
        <h4>Withdrawal of consent</h4>
        <p>
          You may withdraw consent previously given by you to us at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
